# Navigation Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the client's specifications for the navigation bar of the upcoming educational website targeting software course seekers.

## Layout
- The navigation bar should be divided into three main sections: left, center, and right.
- The client will provide the logo at a later stage, which will be positioned on the left side.
- The center of the navigation bar should feature five key categories:
  1. Actions
  2. Endeavour
  3. Intentions
  4. Opportunities
  5. United Workforce

- The right side of the navigation bar should have two call-to-action buttons:
  1. Trainings
  2. Talk to Us

Arjun -> finished creating the outline for it yesterday, Layla has to take care of design of it 

## Responsiveness
- The navigation bar must be mobile-responsive.
- On smaller screens, the navigation items should collapse into a hamburger menu (sandwich bar).

## Color Scheme
- The exact color scheme is pending client finalization.
- Layla (CSS Specialist) is to work with Anya Diaz (Figma Designer) to propose a color palette that is both engaging and appropriate for a younger audience.
- A meeting with the client will be scheduled to finalize the colors.

## Notes for the Team
- Layla, please coordinate with Anya to start brainstorming on the color palette. Use the Figma file shared earlier for reference.
- I will facilitate a session between our team and the client to lock down the exact colors.
- In the meantime, ensure that the CSS is structured to easily adapt to the color changes once finalized.

## Action Items
- Layla & Anya: Begin color scheme collaboration and schedule a meeting with the client for final approval.
- Arjun (HTML Specialist): Prepare the basic structure of the navigation bar and ensure it's ready for the addition of dynamic elements and CSS styling.
- Roger (UI Specialist): Keep the client's preferences in mind when designing the layout and UX for the navigation bar.

Let's aim to have a preliminary design ready for the client's review by the end of this week. Thank you all for your hard work and dedication to making this project a success!

Best,
